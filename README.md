# HoCo
A home control system created for personal use. The functionality is split into two main parts, information and routines.

### Information
The infromation is used for daily commuting. The two displays either show how many CityBikes are at the different stations close by, or which buses are coming / going from the closest bus stop.

The api for CityBikes (Trondheim) can be found at Trondheim Bysykkel, [https://trondheimbysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid](https://trondheimbysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid)
The api for the bus stops can be found at En-Tur, [https://developer.entur.org/pages-nsr-nsr](https://developer.entur.org/pages-nsr-nsr)

### Routines

- Spotify
- Coffee Machine

the ones that are missing are:
- PC (Wake-On-Lan)
- Heater bedroom
- Heater living room
- Lights

These are or will be implemented in several different ways:
